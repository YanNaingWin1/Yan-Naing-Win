            <h2>International Language and Business Center (2005-2006)</h2>
            <p>I went here for the nursery and kintengarden. This was the place where I was introduced to English, which built a solid foundation to the language I am using nowadays. I remember the days walking to school in the early foggy mornings and taking naps before going back to home. Oh, and also the day wearing the graduation gown as a kid too!</p>

            <h2>BEPPS 3 Bahan (2007 - 2012)</h2>
            <p>After kintengarden, my parents decided to send me to a local government school. My first day at this school was bizarre, as the teachers could not find my name on the registered list. This school was also the place where I fell in love with soccer. Studying at this school made me a competitive person overall, especially in terms of academics, which I believe is still my trait until today.</p>

            <h2>BEHS 1 Dagon (2012 - 2013)</h2>
            <p>This school was one of the best local schools in the whole country, but I did not last there long. After attending a few months there, I felt that this place was not right for me. I had fond memories there, made good friends, but in the end, I realized I was in the wrong place. I opened this up to my parents, which resulted in a huge turnaround of my life. I got moved to an international school.</p>

            <h2>Myanmar International School Yangon (2013 - 2020)</h2>
            <p>The beginning of a new era. I was exposed to an international community, where I got the taste of diversity. Interacting with everyone in English massively improved my language skills while I was also able to find more spare time for extracurricular activities. I spent both middle and high school here doing the British curriculum, GCSEs and A-Level. After a seven year journey, I graduated and decided to venture out to Canada to continue my studies.</p>

            <h2>University of British Columbia (2020 - 2025)</h2>
            <p>It has been 2 years since I started studying at UBC. The first year studying online was daunting indeed, but I am getting used to the university life in Canada. Learning in person is a lot more fun with all the people around in lecture halls. It's lively. I am planning to look for a co-op work and hopefully, I will secure it this summer. Can't wait for it!
