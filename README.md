My personal website
Hey everyone! This is just a little website about myself and maybe things you would want to know about me.
I have worked on building websites for quite some time and this is my 3rd time crafting a web. 
The main reason why I did this was because I wanted to polish my HTML and CSS and not stay far away from it, so I do not forget easily. Plus, it's always great to have your own website isn't it?
It's HTML and CSS solely, but I am now learning JavaScript so that perhaps in the future, I can modify this using frameworks like Vue.js or Angular so it's a bit more interactive.
And yes, you might be wondering why my website's on github, and that's because github pages are free to host your website. I am not going to pay for the domain when I can get it for free XDDD. 
Maybe later, I'll pay when it becomes big. IDK.
