I am  from Yangon, Myanmar(Burma), a country to the east of India, south of China and West of Thailand.

            <p>Having spent the early half of my education career at a local goverment school and the other half at an international school, I can say I have experienced the cultures of both education system. Growing up in a local environment made me appreciate the enrichness of the culture my country offered while my teenage days in an international community ensured I got a taste of diversity.</p>

            <p>Soccer, Cooking? Those are a few of my hobbies. My life evolved around soccer and I grew up with a ball at my feet. Cooking? That's something I do everyday, and I always love my own dishes HAHA!! I think they are decent. Maybe, you should try sometimes??</p>

            <h2><a href="projects.html">Projects</a></h2>
            <p>I started creating some projects when I was in high school. My very first was a local website that I made for students at my school. It was a really good experience. I've come a long way, from creating websites to getting some applications work, including a game that I've been working with a few peers here at UBC. I can assure it is a really exciting project!</p>
